# Making Event Sourcing easy 😎

[Event Sourcing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing) is a data storage paradigm that saves **changes in your application state** rather than the state itself.

It is powerful as it enables **rewinding to a previous state** and **exploring audit trails** for debugging or business/legal purposes. It also integrates very well with [event-driven architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture).

However, it is **tricky to implement** 😅

After years of using it at [Theodo](https://dev.to/slsbytheodo), we have grown to love it, but also experienced first-hand the lack of consensus and tooling around it. That's where Castore comes from!
